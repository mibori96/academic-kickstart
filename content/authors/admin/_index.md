I am currently a PhD student in Economics at the University of Valencia under the supervision of Prof. Santiago J. Rubio in the department of Economic Analysis. My thesis is based on the application of Game Theory to environmental economics, in particular to the study of stability in IEAs. Feel free to contact me.
